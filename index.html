    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am B. Darshan, and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Technology with a specialization in Computer Science and Business Systems. My passion lies in becoming a highly skilled full-stack developer, and I have honed my abilities in Python, JavaScript, and worked extensively on projects involving Node and React. The world of web development fascinates me, and I am always ready to learn new technologies and techniques to stay ahead of the curve.</p>

<p>Apart from my technical abilities, I consider myself an outgoing and sociable person, thriving in team environments. Throughout my college journey, I have taken the lead in organizing various events such as symposiums, workshops, and even Model United Nations, showcasing my strong teamwork and leadership skills. As the administrative secretary in my department club, I've learned how to effectively manage a team and ensure our projects are executed successfully.</p>

<p>In my free time, I indulge in my passion for music by playing the guitar, finding it to be a great way to unwind and express myself creatively. Additionally, I have a taste for adventure, and I love going on road trips whenever I get the chance. My drive to explore new territories is not limited to my travels but also extends to my professional life, where I am always open to new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skillset.</p>

<p>With a blend of technical proficiency, strong interpersonal skills, and a thirst for continuous growth, I am confident in my ability to make a meaningful impact in the world of technology. As I continue to learn and develop, I look forward to leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute positively to the tech industry and the broader community.</p>
